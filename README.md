# Moderno Website project

This project is complete HTML, CSS and JS implementations coded entirely by me.  
However, the UI/UX design and template concepts for the project are based on existing design created by others.  
I do not claim ownership of the original design concepts — only the code is mine.

## Project Description
### I made this project to practice my JavaScript learning

- I implemented a responsive navigation menu that can be toggled by clicking a button. It can also be closed by clicking the close (×) icon, clicking outside the menu, or scrolling — all handled with JavaScript.

- I made a scroll-top button that appears after scrolling 500 pixels, and by clicking it scrolls up smoothly.

- The Services section has simple JS code to switch active elements, highlighting the selected service.

- The stories section got a little bit more code, the idea is when clicking on a project, in the box above will display more information about it.

- Finally, in the footer the year of copyright is dynamic using JS
